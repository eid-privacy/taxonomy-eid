# Taxonomy for e-ID

This paper gives an overview of the taxonomy used in the Swiss and EU e-IDs.

We're planning to add evaluation metrics and then apply them on the EU and CH e-ID systems.
Then it will be a Systematization of Knowledge paper.

## LaTeX it

We propose that you [install devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/), and then run:

```bash

```

To create the pdf.
